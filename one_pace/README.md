# One Pace Organizer

## Problem

I have a Plex library called Anime with [HAMA][hama] Absolute Series Scanner,
which pulls seasons, episode names and descriptions for my series. However, I
downloaded [One Pace][one-pace] and I wanted to have a similar organization for
this "anime". I already had the episodes organized by seasons and episodes as I
downloaded each season separately.

I could've go the easy way of using Plex UI and editing each of the titles and
descriptions on my library. But I'm a developer.

## Solution

The script in this folder pulls One Pace arcs and episodes information and edits
the Plex metadata for them.
